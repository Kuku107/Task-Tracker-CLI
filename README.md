Welcome to Task Tracker CLI.  
You can run it by changing the args parameter in App.java file.  
Because it's running from the Task-Tracker command, so you don't have to type param "task-cli" first

Example: in command line -> args

task-cli list -> "list"

task-cli add "message" -> "add", "message"

I'm trying to run it right into the Command Line but it is so hard for newbie like me.

Have a good time.
